  * new io.index.IndexFile.combinations method, should work for
    n-element combinations requires testing

  * methods like io.index.IndexFile.{lists, flat} should take a single
    group name not list of group names; thanks to that the code will be smoother
    and more importantly a user will be able to provide parameters just for 
    a certain group not all

  * planing the implementation of Mean-Square-Displacement and
    Reorientational-Autocorrelation-Function

    In nMoldyn v2 nmoldyn.core.AngularTrajectory function calculates
    an MMTK.Trajectory-like object containing quaternions and cms
    (center-of-mass). The idea is to take a reference structure of a
    certain molecule (e.g. water), superimose it with a consequtive MD
    structures of chosen (all) molecules and save resulting
    quaternions (rotation) and cms (translation). 

    nmoldyn.calc.qTrajectory contains a class inherited after
    MMTK.Trajectory which redefines readParticleTrajectory and adds a
    new method: readRigidBodyTrajectory.

    How to use this idea in modysa: (1) construct AngularTrajectory
    object (!) which might be used to store cms and quaternions and
    (in named property) definition of atomic groups/their molecular
    mass; (2) AngularTrajectory can be used both for calculation of
    MSD and RAF; (3) practical issues: the choice of a reference
    structure (needed for fitting and producing quaternions) seems to
    be important; for water - no problem: use a properly oriented (for
    example: HOH bisected by 0X axis, molecule in XY plane), minimised
    structure of H2O (equilibrium value of HOH angle/length of HO
    bonds), for bigger molecules like HILA there's a need to define
    carefully molecular coordination system with meaningful directions
    of x,y,z axes. It should be noted that in practical applications
    we will probably store independently AngularTrajectories for
    various molecular components of the model system (e.g. different
    trajectories for water, lipids). In case of one-atom moieties,
    e.g. sodium ions, no quaternions present - only cms (there's no
    point in wasting disk space). 

    An unresolved problem is how to treat linear molecules (having two
    or more atoms).

    It seems reasonable to superimpose structures for reference
    structure with more than three, non-colinear atoms. The choice of
    the number and kind of atoms in the reference structure seems to
    be important: we probably need different atoms for analysis of P-P
    vector reorientation in HILA and reorientation of tilt vectors of
    its hc chains. CMS however needs to be calculated for
    independently defined groups, i.e. not 3 atoms used for
    superposition but the whole hc chain or HILA headgroup or even the
    whole HILA molecule. Thanks to that we might calculate diffusion
    of whole molecules or atomic groups (MSD) and rotational diffusion
    just from one AngularTrajectory file.

    core.stack.RigidBodyTrajectory <- migrate rotationMatrix from
    quaternions to geometry.Rotation.setMatrix; leave core.stack.Stack
    (useful: getRigidBodyTrajectory and superpose)
